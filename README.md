# What is Shesha?
Shesha is a [Low Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform) [Application Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_framework) intended to **reduce the effort required to implement typical business applications by over 80%.**

It combines and builds on top of other excellent frameworks and libraries (most notably ASP\.NET Core, Abp\.io, React, NextJs) and layers on additional Low-Code capabilities to further accelerate the development of business applications.

If you are familiar with ASP.NET Core and React, and are in the business of developing business software, and really hate doing the boring and repetitive stuff, Shesha is for you!

## Other things you should know
* Boxfusion intends to open source the core Shesha framework in the hope of building a global community around it and seeing it thrive
* As such it will be the first open-source Low-Code platform that we know of

# How does it differ from other Low-Code frameworks?
* Firstly, it is open-sourced, which means you avoid vendor lock-in and the costs associated with commercial alternatives
* Secondly, it is based on ASP.NET Core and React, two of the world's most popular back-end and web front-end frameworks respectively. If you are familiar with these technologies it should be a natural fit. 
* Finally, as much as there is a huge value in the 'drag & drop' capabilities provided by Shesha to accelerate the implementation of the most common aspects of business applications, you always have the option to revert to traditional custom coding approaches to make sure you are never restricted.

# What does Shesha actually provide?

Shesha is an [opinionated framework](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/802050/what-is-opinionated-software) and therefore defines a 'Best practice' architecture for implementing typical business applications. This includes:
* Project templates to help Shesha application developers [get started quickly](/Getting-started-with-a-new-Shesha-project) and supporting documentation with 'Recipes' for quick implementation of the most common customisation/business requirements
* A UI Configurator that allows application developers and 'Power users' to build application navigation and pages by simply 'dragging and dropping' components onto a page designer.
* 'Out-of-the-box' support for 'plumbing' typically required for most business applications including:
  * Security:
    * User Management
    * Support for various authentication methods (Stand-alone, Active directory, Azure AD, Google, etc...)
    * Role and permissions management
    * Data auditing
    * Logon Audits
  * Administration of Scheduled and Background Jobs
  * Administration of Notification templates and audits
  * Administration of Reference(Lookup) Lists

In addition to all the above which is part of the open-sourced community edition, we also provide Enterprise Features through our commercial packages:
  * Workflow
  * Document generator
  * Reporting
  * (TBD - Additional scalability)
  * (TBD - Cloud management for ISVs)
